This conversation was had with the personal assistant agent.
What it got right, was setting up the calendar. But on sending the email with the link or calendar invitation, that didnt happen.

MY convern is that the agent has a planning tool, vfs tool, but it doesnt really know how to like plan out when a user's intent involves more than one tool.


I need the agent to have a meta-cognitive layer in that, it starts with reasoning about the user's intent to identify what is needed to achieve the users goal.

After classifying the user intent, if it includes more than one tool, it should then have instructions on how to use the planning tool to create a plan on how to achieve the users goal.

In making the plan, the agent llm should be shown all the available tools, conversation history, the tools entities collected so far in case of any entities are needed, and then basically write a series of tasks on what to do to achieve the end goal. 

After making the plan, we have the virtual_fs tool which should be used like the working memory.

This is how the vfs tool should be used:

1. Its contents should always be associated wth a session and persisted to database.
2. At every new session creaetion, I need some files to always be created: a plan.txt, thoughts.txt, web_search_results.txt. 
3. After the metacognitive later thinks about how to achieve the users end goal, these thoughts should be saved in the thoughts.txt file in a structured format eg, user_request, thoughts. I need the agent to know what it knows or what it has thought of so far.

4. When the planning phase, after the agent plans out what to use to achieve the users goal and the steps on how to do this, it should then save this plan inside plan.txt

5. In case of websearch, the agent should save the structured contents of the web search into the web_search.txt file.


After making the plan on how to achieve the user's end goal, then the agent should enter the execution phase. Here, it should retrieve the plan and execute the steps in the plan step by step. after each step execution, a simple LLM evaluation to check if the task is complete which should basically take in the task, the tool results, and decide if the task should be marked as complete. 
Every step and task done, and the task's context/content should be saved inside the plan.txt document

After all tasks are done, then we should have an LLM evaluate what has been done, the results, compare to see if the user's goal has been achieved, report of any problems and reort success if the user's task has been achieved.



Some usecase scenarios can be:

1. user says: I want to quit smoking, help me create a diet plan of what to eat and do everyday for the next 30 days and setup a notification reminder for me on my calendar for everyday for the next 30 days to help me stay on track.

- In this case, the agent should first think and decompose this into a series of tasks to do. The output of this step should just be the thoughts and user's end goal and type of plan ( procedural vs domain; read more below). These then should be saved into thoughts.txt

- Next, the thoughts and decomposed user goal and user query, should be taken to the next step which is writing a plan. Based on the complexity, the agent then makes a plan. Now this part gets very tricky cause its like meta-planning, ie, planing about a plan. In this regards, there are two types of planning:

The Two Types of Planning
Type 1: Procedural Planning (How to execute)

User gives a clear goal
Agent plans the execution steps
Focus: "How do I accomplish this?"

Type 2: Domain Planning (What the plan should contain)

User asks for a plan to be created
Agent plans the content/strategy
Focus: "What should the plan include?"


I forgot to mention, in the thinking phase, the llm should have examples and instructions on different scenarios and directly classify the given goal as either precedural or domain planning so that when it comes to the planning phase, when the LLM sees this in this phase, it has comprehensive detailed set of instructions and examples on how to write a plan on every scenario. 

- And finally now, after the plan is made, always save it to plan.txt using the virtual_fs tool which should persist to database too, what is left is execution and evaluation until the plan is executed to completion. In the plan, we will need to adjust the planning baml function, and honestly, the whole planning tool needs redesign so that its not generic and using naive tasks decomposition, priority determination etc.

then finally, after the whole plan is complete, proceed to evaluating everything thats been done and present the final results to the user.



An important note about the virtual_fs tool. When initializing the mandatory files, the plan.txt, thoughts.txt, web_search_results.txt, they should be done deterministically. By deterministically I mean, after every corrected execution of a tool, the plan.txt should be updated with the new status of the plan or for the thoughts.txt, after every new thoughts have been generated, always save to thoughts.txt. or for web_search_results.txt, after every new web search has been done, always save to web_search_results.txt.

these documents should always be available in the shared_data state which gets accessed on the nodes' prep_async method.
when passing the context to the llm, always include the contents of these files.

After every new thoughts have been generated, always save to thoughts.txt. 
In every step, the contents of these files should be visible to the model via the prompts.
they should be added in like this for example:

Plan.txt: <contents of plan.txt>
Thoughts.txt: <contents of thoughts.txt>
Web Search Results.txt: <contents of web_search_results.txt>



In other instances, the model might decide to write to a file, or read from a file, its instructions should provide clear guide and  instructons on how to use the virtual_fs tool, for instance, the model/agent might deicide midway to use the file system to save some new learning it made, in a memory.txt file, it should have that freedom to read and write to that.


The UI should also support being able to see the contents of the file system, tool execution contents etc. 

Email tools enhancements:

- I need you to include comprehensive instructions in the system prompt on how to send an email
- Always write a contextual email in that it sounds human, considers all neccessary information that maybe happened prior or the initial user request and when signing off, use the user's name's assistant eg, John's assistant. 

Context:
At every baml function call, the conversation history, timezone, time, shared_data context, entity tool store context should always be included to help the model make better decisions.

Calendar tool:
The calendar tool currently maintains timezone information, make sure when creating events, we use the same structure to maintain timezone information:

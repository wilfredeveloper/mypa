# Autonomous Personal Assistant Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of an autonomous architecture for the AI Personal Assistant that enables multi-step task execution with persistent workspace management.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Removed Single Tool Constraint**
- **Before**: Agent limited to "at most one relevant tool" per interaction
- **After**: Agent executes multiple tools sequentially until goal completion
- **Implementation**: Modified system prompts and flow control logic

### 2. **Autonomous Execution Loop**
- **Continuous Evaluation**: After each tool call, agent evaluates if original goal is complete
- **Automatic Progression**: If incomplete, determines and executes next required action
- **Goal Persistence**: Maintains awareness of original objective throughout execution
- **Smart Stopping**: Only stops when task is fully accomplished or clarification needed

### 3. **Virtual File System Workspace**
- **Persistent State**: Uses `virtual_fs` tool as working memory across tool calls
- **Workspace Files**: Creates dedicated workspace file for each multi-step task
- **Progress Tracking**: Updates workspace with execution progress and findings
- **Scratchpad Functionality**: Stores intermediate results and reference materials

### 4. **Enhanced Flow Architecture**

#### Standard Flow (Original)
```
PAThinkNode → PAToolCallNode → PAResponseNode → PAEndNode
     ↓              ↓               ↓
   Single        Execute         Generate
  Decision       One Tool        Response
```

#### Autonomous Flow (New)
```
PAWorkspaceManagerNode → PAAutonomousThinkNode → PAToolCallNode
         ↓                        ↓                    ↓
    Initialize              Evaluate Goal         Execute Tools
    Workspace              Achievement                ↓
         ↓                        ↑                    ↓
         └────────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
                              Continue Loop
                                   ↓
                         PAResponseNode → PAEndNode
```

## Architecture Components

## API Endpoints

### Standard Mode
```http
POST /api/v1/personal-assistant/chat
{
  "message": "Help me plan a meeting",
  "session_id": "optional",
  "context": {}
}
```

### Autonomous Mode
```http
POST /api/v1/personal-assistant/chat/autonomous
{
  "message": "Research TotalEnergies station challenges and create a report",
  "session_id": "optional",
  "context": {},
  "max_steps": 10
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Research Task (Autonomous)
```python
result = await pa_agent.autonomous_chat(
    message="Research station managers in TotalEnergies stations and problems they face",
    context={"research_type": "comprehensive"}
)

# Agent will:
# 1. Create workspace file
# 2. Plan research approach
# 3. Execute web searches
# 4. Compile findings
# 5. Generate comprehensive report
# 6. Update workspace with progress
```

### Planning Task (Autonomous)
```python
result = await pa_agent.autonomous_chat(
    message="Create project plan for customer feedback system",
    context={"complexity": "complex"}
)

# Agent will:
# 1. Initialize planning workspace
# 2. Break down project phases
# 3. Define timelines and resources
# 4. Identify potential challenges
# 5. Create detailed project plan
# 6. Save plan to workspace
```

## Workspace Management

### Workspace File Structure
```markdown
# Task Workspace: {task_id}

## Original Goal
